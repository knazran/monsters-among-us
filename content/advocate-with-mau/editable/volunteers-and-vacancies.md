title: Volunteers & Vacancies
description: From our symposium days to helping children and families through our
  Lapor Predator chatbot, we could not have accomplished all of it without the
  support from our dedicated and supportive volunteers. We believe in the power
  of people and we are looking for youths and individuals of any background that
  are interested to help out in making a difference. If you're on break, still
  studying, or simply looking for something to invest your time and energy in,
  CSA prevention might just be your thing.
