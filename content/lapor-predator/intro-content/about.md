Welcome aboard our mission to fight online sexual crimes against children. We hereby introduce our automated Chatbot. The chatbot functions as a convenient online reporting medium for online sexual exploitation and abuse of children (OCSEA).

> “The first of its kind in Malaysia, anyone - from children to adults - can access and report suspected sexual abuse, online AND offline in Malaysia via our Lapor Predator chatbot.”


Children increasingly have access to the internet and social media platforms as a younger age and for greater proportions of their time. While it is beneficial for their growth, it has also put them at risk of negative exposures; risks accentuated by the Covid-19 pandemic forcing children to spend extensive times on the internet for educational purposes.

    <p class='text-white text-xl'>Perpetrators profit from technological advances to target, groom and abuse children. This risk is further amplified by a lack of parental control on the use of devices and a lack of awareness among children about the risks of their online behavior.
