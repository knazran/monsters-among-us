Welcome aboard our mission to fight online sexual crimes against children. We hereby introduce our automated Chatbot. The chatbot functions as a convenient online reporting medium for online sexual exploitation and abuse of children (OCSEA).

Children increasingly have access to the internet and social media platforms as a younger age and for greater proportions of their time. While it is beneficial for their growth, it has also put them at risk of negative exposures; risks accentuated by the Covid-19 pandemic forcing children to spend extensive times on the internet for educational purposes. 

Perpetrators profit from technological advances to target, groom and abuse children. This risk is further amplified by a lack of parental control on the use of devices and a lack of awareness among children about the risks of their online behavior. 

Recent figures show that 117 Malaysian children were sexually assaulted by perpetrators they met through the Internet, between January and May 2017; Malaysia scored 0/100 in the Out of the Shadows index, indicating a severe lack of Internet protection for our children. Although Malaysia is equipped with some legal framework to combat online child sexual crimes, there is no collaboration between the stakeholders to utilize the platforms and legislations and reporters face many challenges when it comes to reporting due to unclear procedures, lack of moral support by authorities and at times, being left unattended by relevant parties.

Lapor Predator provides an online platform where online child sexual abuse concerns can be reported, removes the obstacles to reporting and assists reporters in each step of the reporting process.
