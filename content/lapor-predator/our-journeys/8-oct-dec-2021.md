### Oct- Dec 2021- ‘You’re in Control!’ Campaign

This campaign was launched to spread the word about what we do at MAU and make sure youths all over know the options available to them in times of need. To educate and instill awareness on how to report cases of sexual abuse and how to be safe when navigating virtual spaces.
