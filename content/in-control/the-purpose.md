Purpose of this campaign - **What is “You’re In Control” for?**

* There’s a bunch of reasons, but our main goal is to let everyone know about our Lapor Predator chatbot. The first of its kind in Malaysia, anyone - from children to adults - can access and report suspected sexual abuse, online AND offline in Malaysia via our Lapor Predator chatbot. 
* We will provide guidance and support throughout the entire process and help you to engage with authorities if necessary. Furthermore, the campaign hopes to educate and share knowledge regarding child sexual abuse and ways to protects ourselves from sexual predators. We want YOU to know how to spot online predators and know the existing laws that protect children from sexual abuse.
* So why “You’re In Control”? We want to let children and young adults across Malaysia know that they can be in control of their online safety and to protect themselves. Even so, parents need to ensure their children are safely surfing online and that they don’t fall victim to predators on the internet. Adults! Don’t turn a blind eye; know who the children around you are talking to online and teach them about online child grooming. Protect them by educating them. YOU’RE IN CONTROL!
