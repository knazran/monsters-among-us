 Our beneficiaries include children from 9 to 13 years old, teenagers from 14 to 18 years old, and young adults from 18 to 30 years old. Young adults in multiple disciplines join our workshops to learn how they can protect the children around them. Since June 2021, it has been conducted almost weekly, and we will still go strong till December 2021!
