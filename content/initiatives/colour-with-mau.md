Colour With MAU is a childrenâ€™s colouring book that may serve as an initial guide for parents, guardians and educators as well as children who want to ease into sexuality education. Colour With MAU came into being to mitigate the lack of comprehensive sexuality education which is accessible to children from all backgrounds and which enables them to learn about topics such as intimacy, sexual abuse and navigating the legal protection that is available to them in Malaysia. The content of the book is tailored according to the social and cultural factors that affect children in Malaysia. 

Colour with MAU has been in production since January 2021 and will be launched on 24th September 2021 in conjunction with World Youth Day. 9 local artists were commissioned to realise the content of the book in each of their unique and distinctive ways.

The 9 artists contributing are:-
