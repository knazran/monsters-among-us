## Background

'My Body, My Rules' is a children’s colouring book that may serve as an initial guide for parents, guardians and educators as well as children aged 13 - 17 years old who want to ease into sexuality education. 'My Body, My Rules' came into being to mitigate the lack of comprehensive sexuality education which is accessible to children from all backgrounds and which enables them to learn about topics such as intimacy, sexual abuse and navigating the legal protection that is available to them in Malaysia. The content of the book is tailored according to the social and cultural factors that affect children in Malaysia.

'My Body, My Rules' was first launched in 2021 through a small grant awarded by SEAFAM. With the support of the German Embassy in Kuala Lumpur and the Canadian Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI), MAU is able to expand the spirit of 'My Body My Rules' to further develop and sustain children-led, gender just and safe communities through addressing intersecting identities of the children and youth population in Malaysia. From a colouring book, 'My Body My Rules' has manifested in different forms to engage and touch the hearts of children from diverse background.

Monsters Among Us organised Ini Cerita Kami // This is Our Story: Art by Children of Malaysia. We engaged with 29 young people aged between 10 to 18 years old as we explored topics such as growing up, sex and sexuality, consent and safety and many more. We shared a space where they could ask about things that probably sounded “too sensitive”, “too offensive” and “too adult for them”.

The children chose matters closest to them. They created art about their homes, their hobbies and their aspirations. We invite you to listen to their stories. This is an experience that we welcome you to embark on with an intention to revisit your own personal childhood experiences; were you ever heard? Did the adults around you take you seriously? And did you feel safe as a child?

 We hope that through the stories that these children have entrusted us with inspire us to be adults that celebrate children in all of their diversities to grow, flourish and achieve their full potential.

**What now?**

We are training 25 young community leaders as CSE providers, using the colouring book as a module so that different communities are able to sustain a CSE module that is rights-based, age and gender responsive. The programme is supported CFLI
