## Background

'My Body, My Rules' is a children’s colouring book that may serve as an initial guide for parents, guardians and educators as well as children who want to ease into sexuality education. 'My Body, My Rules' came into being to mitigate the lack of comprehensive sexuality education which is accessible to children from all backgrounds and which enables them to learn about topics such as intimacy, sexual abuse and navigating the legal protection that is available to them in Malaysia. The content of the book is tailored according to the social and cultural factors that affect children in Malaysia.

'My Body, My Rules' is currently available for orders. 10 local artists were commissioned to realise the content of the book in each of their unique and distinctive ways. Special shoutout to Shamrizan Jamaludin Indasya Zubir, Aida Masturina, Dizrieana Izrin, Shuhufan Shukardi, Daniel Norazman, Atsmara, Rasyid and Sook Kuan.

***MY BODY, MY RULES: Celebrating Bodies And Experiences For A Child-Friendly Community*** 

In 2021, we released a locally-illustrated sex-ed colouring book, 'MY BODY, MY RULES',  to mitigate the lack of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) in Malaysia.

THIS year, in partnership with German Embassy KL we’re delighted to share an extension of that: our ‘MY BODY MY RULES’ (MBMR) community-driven initiative — an art-based sex education workshops for kids AND a 5-DAYS physical art exhibition, that will include a bunch of other exciting activities!

Joining hand with intersectional community leaders, we hope to centre those most susceptible to sexual violence, as we make space for more gender-just education on sexuality in Malaysia, for a child-friendly community. 

Come celebrate your bodies and experiences with us!
