**Background**  
In Malaysia, institutional injustices and social norms have sustained a status quo of silencing and stigmatizing violence against children, which violates their human rights. Their interests are not represented in legislation, government policies and programmes. Discriminatory social norms also have had an impact on the ability of certain groups of children to realize their rights to protection and participation. These include gender norms of those with disabilities, adolescents from rural and remote areas, LGBTQIA+, stateless or undocumented and refugee adolescents.

Efforts to confront violence against children will not succeed unless founded on what children and young people need. This requires involving them as active participants in finding solutions to issues affecting them following their age and evolving capacities.

**Objectives**  
Through Our Lens aims to enable children to reclaim their agencies and equip them with the necessary knowledge and tools to protect themselves and advocate for online safety.

**Project Details:**  
'Through Our Lens' Project is one of the many projects of MAU created to accomplish our ultimate mission; to ensure that MAU, a youth-led child rights-based organization, caters to the needs and reflects the voices of our children and young people. Frequently programs and initiatives for children were developed without including them as critical partners. They are always treated as the receiving end. With the normalization of this culture, power is always within the control of the giver, i.e. adults, while children remain the dependent group. We were passionate about initiating this change.

_"Adolescents are partners and change agents who can positively influence the matters that affect their lives, both individually and collectively."_

We wished to develop child advocates who are aware of their rights and can exercise them to protect themselves and their peers from sexual violence against children. On the other hand, this project aims to strengthen MAU's capacity as a children-centric NGO to implement initiatives that reflect the needs of our children more accurately.
