## Conceptualizing Child Rights

### Bite-Sized Definition
A set of promises to keep children safe and happy and it needs to be fulfilled by adults in power. 

### Definition of the term ‘child’
- According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), a child is defined as a person who is under the age of 18.
- According to Child Act 2001 (section 2), a child is defined as a person who is under the age of 18.

## Why do children have established rights? 

To ensure the rights of every human under 18 years old  are recognised and protected regardless of gender, race, religious beliefs, income, physical attributes, geographical location or other status.[^3]

### 1. Right to Adequate Standard of Living

Failing to fulfill this right will result in children living in poverty. By ensuring an adequate standard of living, numbers of children who failed completing school, entering the labour force and involved in juvenile crimes could be decreased significantly. 

### 2. Right to life and basic health

Failing to ensure access to clean water, sufficient nutritious food supplies, qualified doctors services, prenatal/maternal/neonatal care of a child violates this right. Children have the right to live a life free from preventable hardships. 

### 3. Right to early childhood development and education

Failing to take appropriate measures in ensuring children to receive equal opportunity in exploring during their formative early years will result in disruption of their cognitive and social emotional development hence overall well being. 

### 4. Right to identity, care and protection

Failing to guarantee children to have their own identity resulting in limited access to social services and risk of facing maltreatments and exploitations. Having an identity means to be lawfully recognized as a part of the society. Generally, registering newborns immediately guarantees their right to a name and nationality.  Registered newborns will be granted birth certificates and it becomes useful when a call for judicial capacities entails ie. access to healthcare, rehabilitation centres etc. 


## Global Child Rights (United Nation)

### Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) 

This is an international agreement on children's rights whereby it provides a legal framework (basic legal benchmark) for countries to refer and adapt to in order to protect the welfare of humans below the age of 18 years old. Through the signing of this convention, leaders all around the world are required to ensure expectations through standards that were set forth in the convention to be met. There were 194 countries (known as State Parties) who signed the convention and they needed to provide its first report within two years after signing, with subsequent reports every five years.
  
CRC was opened for signature in 1989 and Malaysia became a part of this convention on 17th February 1995. Below is the excerpt of Malaysia’s  declaration over the convention. 

> Reservation: 
>> "The Government of Malaysia accepts the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child but expresses reservations with respect to articles 2, 7, 14, 28 paragraph 1 (a) and 37, of the Convention and declares that the said provisions shall be applicable only if they are in conformity with the Constitution, national laws and national policies of the Government of Malaysia."

>> "With respect to article 28 paragraph 1 (a) of the Convention, the Government of Malaysia wishes to declare that with the amendment to the Education Act 1996 in the year 2002, primary education in Malaysia is made compulsory. In addition, the Government of Malaysia provides monetary aid and other forms of assistance to those who are eligible."

## Child Rights in Malaysia
Since Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1995, Malaysia enacted the Child Act [Act 611] in 2001. However it is worth noting that this Act is actually a fuse of three Acts ( Juvenile Courts Act 1947 [Act 90], Women and Girls Protection Act 1973 [Act 106] and the Child Protection Act 1991 [Act 468] thus repealed these three pieces of legislation.

### Child Act
This Act was enacted specifically to fulfill the obligation after being a part of the CRC. There are 135 sections in the Child Act 2001, which have been divided into 15 parts. It is also structured into Parts in which the following are the main areas:

1. Courts for Children (Part IV);
2. Children in need of care and protection (Part V);
3. Children in need of protection and rehabilitation (Part VI);
4. Beyond control (Part VII);
5. Trafficking in and Abduction of children (Part VIII); and
6. Criminal Procedure in Court for Children (Part X).

### Has the Child Act 2001 ever gone through revision? 
Yes. The recent amendment was made in 2016 [^4] which leads to the enactment of Child (Amendment) Act 2016 by the parliament of Malaysia. This amendment guarantees on matters which are

1. Child Registry
2. Community Service Order (CSO)
3. Family Based Care 
4. Heavier Penalties (in cases of negligence) 

### How Does the Child Act Protect Children? 
The Child Act of 2001 [^5] makes it illegal to report and publish children in the media, ill-treatment, neglect, abandonment and abuse of children. It also ensures rehabilitation measures for children who violate certains laws. 

### Disparities
Although amendments were made, there are still remaining discrepancies that have yet to be  resolved. While the Child Act ensures rehabilitation measures for children who violate laws, these children  are still not being provided with specific rights that they could be referred to. Other than that, the issue of how different laws define the term ‘child’ differently. This inconsistency in defining the term ‘child’ can be seen through federal[^6] and regional laws[^7].The minimum age of criminal responsibility for Children in Conflict with the Law Under the Penal Code remains at 10 years of age, contradicting recommendations from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. 

Furthermore, there are discrepancies between the Penal Code and Sharia laws on the minimum age of criminal responsibility. Children are at the mercy of their arresting officers and judicial employees. The failure of police to inform the child's parents or guardians of the arrest; the lack of access to legal representation; the fact that probation officers are typically not involved until the child is brought to court; and the use of force by police officers during arrest and questioning are cited as key issues at the arrest, investigation, and bail stages. 22 Children can be imprisoned in remand or pre-trial custody for extended periods without being separated from adult offenders. The Malaysian juvenile justice system continues to emphasize formal police and court-based interventions and institutional rehabilitation. There are presently no legislation or policy directives in Malaysia that promote restorative justice programmes, including diversion, for children. Detention sentences are often imposed, as opposed to being a last resort. While children are seldom sentenced to jail, they are sent to Probation Hostels and Approved Schools considerably more frequently, and are often put away for three years for relatively minor offenses. These predetermined penalties are not only disproportionate to the offenses, but also worse than the punishments adults would have gotten for the same offense.
