All active members and volunteers of the organisation are fully equipped to understand and abide by our child protection policy and work to the same high standards in order to uphold children’s rights.

Any and all concerns of a child’s safety are taken very seriously and responded to very quickly by case managers assigned by MAU.

We are also committed to protecting and respecting a child’s dignity and privacy by ensuring that every social media volunteer abides by the high standards of media and marketing guidelines that have been set by our child protection policy.

We value child-centred decision-making that recognises the vulnerability of children.
