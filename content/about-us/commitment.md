1. We hold the highest standards of child protection whereby we ensure that respect and support towards children’s rights are embedded in the organisation’s culture and are practised by all members as well as project collaborators. 
2. We are committed to dismissing candidates or personnel with any credible allegations of offence against them to minimise the risk of damage or danger towards children and members of the organisation.
3. All active members and volunteers of the organisation are fully equipped to understand and abide by our child protection policy and work to the same high standards in order to uphold children’s rights.
4. Any and all concerns of a child’s safety are taken very seriously and responded to very quickly by case managers assigned by MAU. 
5. We are also committed to protecting and respecting a child’s dignity and privacy by ensuring that every social media volunteer abides by the high standards of media and marketing guidelines that have been set by our child protection policy.  
6. We value child-centred decision-making that recognises the vulnerability of children.
7. Our child protection policy can and will always be improved as the organisation grows.
