 **MAU**  Mainboard members and program volunteers are trained to understand childrenâ€™s rights and their protection in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Besides that, our initiatives revolve around youth empowerment, community involvement in creating safer spaces for children and survivors, survivor-centric activism and education for prevention.

In years to come, we hope that our initiatives are able to catalyse change within Malaysian child protection systems, filling the lacunae as they do so. Hoping to correct broken structures locally as well as globally,  **MAU**  promises to evolve as we set out to realise our mission and vision of making this world a safe space for children to grow and develop.
