**Monsters Among Us (MAU)** began in 2017 as a youth-led movement to combat child sexual abuse (CSA). The early work culminated in a symposium that involved and gathered stakeholders as well as subject experts, but our founder Firzana Redzuan realised soon after that the fight against CSA was far from over.

Today, **MAU** stands as a non-profit organisation with a membership of 70. 

Square one for **MAU** was the belief that CSA was a niche segment of human rights in Malaysia; this was the angle from which we approached the struggle in the first year. However, ensuing years have taught us important lessons leading to the understanding that the fight against CSA is not one to be won with tunnel vision. At present, our mission is to combat systemic violence against children in Malaysia through youth-led child rights advocacy so as to realise our vision of a world where all children are empowered to grow, flourish and achieve their full potential. 

An issue within the realm of activism is that children are not given access to avenues that can serve as safe spaces for them to speak out, and even if they are, privacy is often an issue. There is also a dearth of mediums of reporting for online CSA and exploitation. **MAU** aims to carve out such avenues and mediums.

With that in mind, our organisational development is strategized to prioritise advocacy-heavy and survivor-friendly capacity strengthening, community engagements and messaging. To this effect, **MAU** has substantially revamped and upgraded our internal policies to be closely in line with Child Protection Policies approved by our partner, Child Safe Alliance.
