**Interns Diary** 

3rd - 14th October

Episode 01

*Disclaimer: The Interns Diary is a compilation of several bi-weekly journal entries penned by MAU’s current Intern, Tanish Tanjil. Her internship period lies between September 2022 - January 2023. The purpose of this diary is to allow the readers a ‘Behind the Scene’ perspective of how MAU works! The MAU team hopes you will enjoy reading these bite-sized, broken-humour & fire-cracker-filled journal entries by our quirky 17-year-old intern. Bon Appetit!* 

**Title of the episode: Fir is Leaving!...**

*Week 1: 3rd October - 7th October*

Dear Diary, 

“Learn, Contribute & Grow” are the three words I would use to describe my internship with Monsters Among Us (MAU). It was nothing but a massive rush of bliss within my veins when I found out I passed the 2nd stage of the application process, which is \*drumrolls\* the INTERVIEW. The founder, Fir and Executive Officer, Mahera, were benign and pleasant human beings, and I felt warm and welcomed from the very first day! Let's jump into some fun bits now!

NO, NO, hold on! Before we start, here are a few things to note! :D \*takes out pen and notepad\*

*Note #1: My internship started on the 26th of September. However, this “Intern’s Diary” will date from the 3rd of October since your girl can only be so productive…I thought it would be much easier to start in October hehe.*

*Note #2: Fir is leaving! Uhuh, heard that right, my friends. SHE IS. She is going to Nepal for 3 weeks...3 WEEKS! To climb MOUNT EVEREST! (i am not joking) though it is a base camp but BEST OF LUCK, FIR! This means, Mahera and I have to show real 'autonomy power' to complete the work!*

Okay, Let’s Begin!

The week started with our weekly meeting on Monday! Given my background and experience in copywriting, Fir knew she had to exploit them to the max ;( Hence my first few tasks were based around that. We are currently working on a GRAND FAQ.pdf for MAU, which shall answer all the frequently asked questions by everyone! From what MAU is to what MAU has been. Everything. Later that week, Fir & I hopped on a meeting with the ever-so-talented web developer (yes, he is uploading this from google docs to the laporpredator.org website. A shout-out to him!) to discuss how we can provide a better user experience!

Since it was just the first week, Fir (our kind godmother) didn’t assign much work. However, before leaving, she did provide Mahera and me a beautiful but extensive task sheet document entailing the next 3 weeks, which you readers and I shall voyage together!

Week 2: 10th October - 14th October

Not gonna lie; the 2nd week was monotonous. Fir left, Mahera and I had loads to do, and most of my work felt like freelancing! Nevertheless, this allowed me to explore how MAU works around its Media and Communication and that I would have much to do in that sector! Shout-out to Henry, our social media volunteer who works really hard on some of the posts that go out there on our social media page. In fact, Henry and I just got on a call last night to schedule the EXCITING content calendar for October! To keep the suspense, I shall give you one hint. Just one. We have something BIG happening on the 30th of October!!! 

And, with that suspense, I shall stop typing or falling asleep on this keyboard at 3am and journal this entry for you. See you in two weeks. Till then, Good Night :)
