On 30th October 2022, Through Our Lens Graduation Ceremony was held at Gaia Space, Shah Alam for 17 of our child advocates aged between 12 to 18 years old. The event was hosted to celebrate the important and impressive work that our child advocates have organised amongst themselves including developing their advocacy skills through child rights workshops, contributing at consultations and executing their very own
micro-projects.

`“Today here we are,
Standing up for the rest of the world,
Today here we are,
Defending every single boy and girl.”`

`Yashmita Sarna, MAU Child Advocate’s Poem entitled, “I proudly say..”`

Through Our Lens project aims to develop child advocates who are aware of their rights and able to exercise them; to protect themselves and their peers from sexual violence against children; and to strengthen MAU's capacity as a children-centric NGO to implement initiatives that reflect the needs of our children more accurately.

During the Through Our Lens Graduation Ceremony, MAU showcased a line of amazing forum speakers by Cikgu Rahayu, Social and Education Activist from MUDA, Jason Wee, Co-founder of Architects of Diversity and Ain Husniza, Advocate for #MakeSchoolASaferPlace through the Young Changemakers Call to Action Forum.

Our very own outstanding children advocates proudly shared about their amazing micro-projects which ranged from different topics such as Cyberbullying, Domestic Violence, Child Marriage Debate and Sexual Harassment.

`“Children in schools are conditioned to believe that their opinions and thoughts are unimportant. We observe that whenever a posed to a group of students, no one would answer it. We need to tackle this. Creating space for children to participate is one issue, making children believe that they should participate is another.”`

`Jason Wee, Architects of Diversity`

In Malaysia, institutional injustices and social norms have sustained a status quo of silencing and stigmatising violence against children, which violates their human rights. Their interests are not represented in legislation, government policies and programmes. Discriminatory social norms have also an impact on the abilitychildren to realise their rights to protection and participation who come from groups with disabilities, living in rural and remote areas, sexual minority adolescents and stateless, undocumented and refugee adolescents. Efforts to confront violence against children will not succeed unless founded on what children and young people
themselves need.

This requires involving them as active participants in finding solutions to issues affecting them, in accordance with their age and evolving capacities.

`“A simple scenario for us to ponder upon - holidays in schools; are children consulted on deciding which days should be their holidays? Many important positions that involve decision making regarding children’s lives are all monopolised by adults, where are the children? We should start treating children as equal decision makers.”`

`Cikgu Rahayu`
