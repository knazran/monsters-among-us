## INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL CHILD

International Day of The Girl is a day declared by the United Nations in 2012 to raise awareness on **gender inequality that young girls face worldwide.** While **shining light on issues such as forced child marriages, access to education, and protection from discrimination, this day also celebrates young girls’ efforts and contributions to the world.**

This year’s theme, “**Digital Generation. Our Generation**”, highlights the **gender gap within the digital revolution**. **Girls are more likely to get left behind as this digital gender gap negatively affects their access to information, connection, education, and progress especially in the tech field.** Together, let’s play our part to achieve digital revolution equality for girls of the future generations. Let’s take a look in Malaysia and the individuals and programmes that empower young girls to participate in STEM.
