At the beginning of this project, I had a very idealistic perspective of the kind of impact that  I would be creating as part of the Child Protection Department. The Case Managers I worked with shared similar sentiments - we used to (at the beginning of our respective tenures with MAU) believe that we would be making an immediate difference for survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA)  by receiving reports, pinning perpetrators and duly bringing them to justice on behalf of our child clients.

However, after considering my experiences for the past few months, my perception has **shifted**. I have learnt that the fight against CSA is an especially arduous one, what more in a country which boasts strong Asian values and where most still consider CSA to be taboo. This means that such crimes are extremely **under-reported**. The Lapor Predator project focuses on creating a convenient online reporting medium for child sexual exploitation and abuse through our chatbot. The Child Protection Department, which I led, are the people behind the chatbot who are the first to receive these reports and subsequently map out crisis intervention plans to assist our clients.

The primary challenge that we faced when dealing with child clients is the inability to move forward with the reporting process without the consent or support of their parents. In most cases, survivors opt to not report because this would mean having to tell their parents about their experiences, which they understandably refuse to out of fear of the repercussions they may face. In some cases, even when the child has (very bravely) opened up to their parents about the abuse, it is their parents who are unwilling to report and instead choose to sweep the entire incident under the rug and convince the child that it is in their best interests to do so. 

My initial response to these occurrences was to label such parents or caregivers as irresponsible or selfish. Yet now I find it more tempting to ask why they refuse to take legal action against the perpetrators who have harmed their own children. It makes no sense to rely on the assumption that they do not care about their own kids. Therefore, I find it more accurate to suggest that it is simply the lack of knowledge and education surrounding child sexual abuse that causes many parents to recoil at the idea of reporting (which essentially means informing others) of the abuse. There is **so much shame surrounding this issue** that inevitably causes many children to suffer in silence. 

I now understand that our role as child protectors is **multifold**. We do not just receive reports and go on to pursue legal action without considering the wishes of our client. We carry the immense responsibility of listening and holding space for survivors who have been through such harrowing experiences. They have already been in a position where they had no control or choice surrounding their personal autonomy. The last thing we want to do is make them feel like they have no say in what happens once they confide in us.  We do our best to give them the freedom of choice in deciding the best course of action for themselves while empowering them with the knowledge necessary to make these choices.

I realise that the support and services we provide as Case Managers is not just limited to our child clients. There have been instances where parents themselves have reached out to us for guidance and support, as they struggle to process what their child has been through. 

The Lapor Predator chatbot gives children the opportunity to open up about their abuse and offers them a support system when they have nowhere else to turn to. Even if we may not achieve our goal of reporting to the authorities, we do our best to listen, guide and offer counselling services from referral partners for those who are in need of it. We have had clients who express hope and excitement for their future after a few sessions with our Case Managers - simply because they needed the reassurance that they are still worthy despite what has happened. Ultimately, I am sure of one thing - children need to know that their voices matter, and that is what the Child Protection Department at MAU will continue to strive for.
