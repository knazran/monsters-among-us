When children are exposed to pornography at a young age, it can have many harmful effects towards their mental health as well as their physical health. Watching pornography could also change one’s views about sex. Talking to your child about pornography can be tough, however, it is a necessary thing to do. Let’s discuss what we can do when our children is exposed to pornography.

Before the conversation

During the conversation

3. Reassure your child that they are safe and not in trouble!

* We are aware of how distressing it might be to see things of this nature, we must be encouraging and understanding.

  * good, bad, safe, scared, uncomfortable, curious, or something else?
