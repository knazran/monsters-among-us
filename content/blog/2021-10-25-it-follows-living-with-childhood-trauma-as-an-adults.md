description: TW // Child Sexual Abuse For World Trauma Day, we are sharing a
  short story about a traumatic childhood incident. Written by our Content
  Writer, Fateen Ariff, it's a story that was shared by a friend, who was brave
  and generous enough to give us permission to share it on our platforms. She
  adds that if anything is taken away from her story, she hopes that it is that
  we all learn to empathise with each other. And of course, to always be kind.

One day when I was eleven, I went on a bike ride around the neighbourhood, following the normal routes from my house past my primary school to the nearby playground. 

It was still too warm for anyone to be outdoors, so I was basically on my own. Not that it mattered. This was a time when children could play outside in relative safety without adult supervision (or mobile phones!).

Alone, I continued cycling, waving and calling out hello at familiar faces. It was a tight community and though we didn't know everyone's names, we could at least recognise each other.

#### **People are born with only two fears: falling and loud noises. Everything else is learned.**

I was at a cul-de-sac when a man on a motorbike drove by and stopped at a small park sandwiched between two houses. He was several meters away from me and I didn't pay him any attention.

I didn't even change directions. I just continued cycling, knowing yet not at all bothered that I'd be riding past where he was.

He was still on his motorcycle when I approached, looking at a piece of paper in his hand with his engine running.

"Dik, dik," he suddenly called out when I was within earshot. "Tolong kejap."

### **Don't speak to strangers" and "Respect your elders" can be two confusing statements for a child.**

I stopped. Because at a time when GPS wasn't predominant, it was perfectly normal for people to ask for directions. Because I was young and I didn't think twice about stopping.

He held out the paper, on which the address of a street I recognised was written. I told him how to get there, and he smiled as he thanked me.

"Adik duduk sini ke?" he asked after slipping the note back in his pocket.

I told him yes, I lived in the area.

"Umur berapa?"

"Sebelas," I answered without hesitation.

"Ohhh..." he murmured. There was suddenly something...odd about his tone. "Umur sebelas masih pakai seluar pendek? Tak boleh macam ni, dik. Tengok, tetek pun dah besar!"

I was too shocked to respond. Too shocked to even move - and he took advantage of that. Quick as a snake, he reached out and squeezed one of my breasts.

I immediately recoiled. It happened so quickly yet it felt like everything was in slow motion. I must have made some noise of protest (though I can't recall) because he let go and before I knew it, he sped off to the opposite direction on his motorcycle.

He was laughing as he drove away.

### **I waited for my heart to stop pounding and my knees to stop shaking. Then I just went home. I didn't even cry.**

Looking back, there are tons of things I wish I'd done. I shouldn't have stopped. Shouldn't have spoken to him. I should have instantly screamed for help.

I should have told my parents.

But I didn't. I didn't do any of these things. I just went home and took a really long shower. Then I had dinner, did my homework, and watched cartoons with my siblings until bedtime. I acted as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened to me that day.

But of course, something did happen. Something that unexpectedly cracked my foundation. That afternoon, in a split second with an awful man, I discovered my sexuality as girl - and how it can be used against me as a weapon for anyone who thought they had the power.

It made me realise that as a female, I could be seen as prey.

Also, I've never worn shorts since that day. Not even once.

### **It doesn't happen every time. Sometimes I'm afraid, sometimes it doesn't cross my mind at all.**

It's been more than two decades since the incident. I don't remember his face at all, just that he wore glasses and he had on one of those black waterproof jackets riders often wear. And sometimes, I swear I can hear his laughter.

What does linger more strongly is the anxiety. It comes and goes and I can never predict when it will strike. I could be walking to my car in a parking lot and hear the rumblings of a motorcycle and would immediately flinch, reaching for my keys and clutching them between my fingers like I'm Wolverine.

But then at other times, I could be jogging in the evening and a motorbike would pass by closely enough for me to smell the gas from his exhaust and I wouldn't even blink. I've ridden on friends' motorcycles, greeted delivery riders with warm hellos and even once dated a guy who drove a really nice speedster.

Yet, once in a while, in the middle of the night, I'd hear a motorbike drive in front of the house. Despite being in a secured neighbourhood in a secured house with family members sleeping nearby, I'd lay awake for a long time, willing myself to stop being afraid.

### **I've had to force myself not to compare traumas to "prove" my absurdity**

It could have been worse, right? Once I understood what had occurred that day, I'd repeat this line over and over again. I'd use it when I feel stupid for being so jumpy around motorcyclists. When I feel ashamed for judging innocent riders for the action of one stupid man. When I can't seem to get over the anxiety.

Truth is, I was lucky. It could have been worse. But using comparisons as a coping mechanism is not just ineffective, it can also be unjust to survivors of more horrific experiences.

Do I still get anxious? Yes, sometimes. Have I sought professional help? No. Have I ever told my parents the story? No. The only people I've spoken about this with are my girl friends, as an adult during a gab session in which we compared creepy childhood incidents.

As it turns out, I wasn't the only one among us who experienced such things as a child.
