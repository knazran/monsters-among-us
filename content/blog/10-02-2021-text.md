Colour With MAU is a childrenâ€™s colouring book that stands as a basic guide for parents, guardians and educators as well as children who want to ease into learning about Sexuality Education. This initiative was started by MAU due to the lack of comprehensive sexuality education that is engaging and easy for children from all diversities to understand and learn about the intricacies of Sexuality Education which engulfs topics such as intimacy, sexual abuse and navigating through the ins and outs of legal protection that is available to them in Malaysia. The content developed in this book is specific to the social and cultural factors that do affect children in Malaysia.

This colouring book has been in production since January 2021 and will be launched on the 12th of August 2021, in conjunction with World Youth Day. Monsters Among Us has commissioned 9 local artists to sketch each topic that is projected in the colouring book. The outlines are unique to the art styles of each of the artists that we have commissioned.
